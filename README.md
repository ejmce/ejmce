- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Elmer McElmeel @ejmce
- I am using github to serve as a temporary portfolio up until when/if I decide purchasing a domain is once again worth it.
- The current main project is the County-Adj list. This was done at a time when I had never previously coded with C#, but it was able to land me my first development job.
- Many of the current projects on here are from college projects I pulled from, as well as self learning at the time.
- Thank you,
